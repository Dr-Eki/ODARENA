# ODARENA Project Governance

## Overview

The ODARENA project uses a governance model commonly described as Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL). This document outlines our understanding of what this means.

## Roles

* User: Anyone who plays OpenDominion.
* Veteran: Anyone who plays plays OpenDominion and has also played Dominion in the past.
* Contributor: Anyone who committed code to the project. They can be found on the [contributors](https://github.com/Dr-Eki/ODARENA/graphs/contributors) page.
* Collaborator: Anyone who committed code to the project multiple times and have shown significant interest in helping the project move forward.
* BDFL: A single individual who makes decisions when consensus cannot be reached. ODARENA's current BDFL is [@Dreki](https://github.com/Dr-Eki).

## Decision making process

Decisions will be made by trying to reach consensus in discussions between the BDFL and collaborators, with input from everyone else (especially veterans). In case consensus cannot be reached, the BDFL makes a decision.
