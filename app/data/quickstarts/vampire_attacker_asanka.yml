name: Vampires (Surveyor) Quickstart by Asanka2
description: There are 12 ticks left. I would suggest with 8 ticks remaining to build 100 Shrines and 50 Guard Towers. The idea is to attack barbs for first day or so as many times as safely possible and then start attacking players. Convert your gold mines to Mansions and focus on population and training Nobles. Use the 8 tick build time as well as low cost to R/R to mod buildings when needed to attack.
