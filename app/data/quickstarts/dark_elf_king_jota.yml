description: DE is a slow race with great wizards and unique features involving prisoners who can be put at use in slave mines to generate strong improvements or be enlisted in the Dark Elf military as Slave soldiers. The quickstart has enough op to attack a bot and at the same time a fair defense. Enjoy!
