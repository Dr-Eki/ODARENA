name: Afflicted
alignment: evil
description: >-
  <p>For any invasion where the Afflicted are at least half as strong as the defender, a <strong>Pestilence</strong> will linger with the defender causing their peasants to die and quickly decompose into Abominations which start the long walk back to their Afflicted masters.</p>
  <p>If the invasion is successful, a malady known only as <strong>Great Fever</strong> will also befall the defender.</p>
  <p>Anyone invading the Afflicted will bring back with them a terrible disease called <strong>Festering Wounds</strong>.</p>
  <hr />
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Pestilence</strong>: (1% * [Land Ratio]) of target's peasants die and return to the Afflicted as Abominations (takes 12 ticks).</li>
  <li><strong>Great Fever</strong>: no population growth, -10% gold production, -20% food production.</li>
  <li><strong>Festering Wounds</strong>: +25% casualties, +25% food consumption.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each spell lasts 12 ticks.</p>
