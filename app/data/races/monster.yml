name: Monster
alignment: evil
description: >-
  <p>Awakend from the Great Divide, the Monster is the common term used to refer to this gargantuan beast under magical control by the Empire.</p>
  <p>It consists of an ever-changing configuration of claws, muscles, limbs, and heads, forged and fused from organic matter, rocks, and trees.</p>
  <p>The Monster can have at most one claw per limb and it needs at least twenty muscles to support each head.</p>
  <p>If the Monster is present, the Governor is tasked with setting a contribution rate of 0% to 10%. All Imperial dominions must contribute this amount of their food, ore, and lumber stockpile every tick to the Monster. The caretaker of the Monster may exchange resources at a favourable rate.</p>
