name: Monster
alignment: evil
description: >-
  <p>The Monster is not a faction. It's a single, gargantuan monster tenuously aligned with the Empire and its vision for unending domination.</p>
  <p>The Monster gets stronger from combat. Strength generated is based on raw military power used by both sides.</p>
  <p>The amount of strenght generated (or lost) is calculated in the following manner:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Successful invasion: 10% of own raw OP required to break the target and 10% of the target's raw DP.</li>
    <li>Non-overwhelmed failed invasion: <code>7.5% * [OP:DP Ratio]</code> of own raw OP and <code>5% * [OP:DP Ratio]</code> of target's raw DP.</li>
    <li>Overwhelmed failed invasion: <code>-20% * (1/[OP:DP Ratio])</code> of own raw OP and <code>-10% * [OP:DP Ratio]</code> of target's raw DP.</li>
    <li>Successfully fending off: 10% of own raw DP and 10% * of the invader's raw OP.</li>
    <li>Failed fending off (successfully invaded): <code>-7.5% * [OP:DP Ratio]</code> of invader's raw OP.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Starts with 2 Heads, 100 Limbs, 200 Claws, and 10 Carapaces, and 25,000 strength. No protection.</p>
