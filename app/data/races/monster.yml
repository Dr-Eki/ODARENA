  <p>Awakened from the Great Divide, the Monster is the commonly used term used to refer to an ancient gargantuan beast under magical control by the Empire.</p>

  <p>If the Monster is present, the Governor is tasked with setting a contribution rate of 0% to 10%. All Imperial dominions must contribute this amount of their food, ore, and lumber stockpile every tick to the Monster. The caretaker of the Monster may exchange resources at a favourable rate.</p>
