description: >-
  <p>The Empress has struck a deal with an ancient evil and allied the Empire with Demonic beasts.</p>
  <p>Demonic loyalty is always capricious, but as long as there are souls to collect and blood to bathe in, the Demons will follow the Empress.</p>
  <p>The soul of every enemy unit slain and all blood spilled in battle is collected.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Blood collected is equal to 1/3 gallons per 1 raw military power of each unit slain (DP if killed on defense, OP if killed on offense), or 1.5 gallon per peasant sacrificed.</p>
  <p>Each sacrificed peasant or killed enemy soldier yields 1 soul.</p>
  <p>Starts with 1 Archdemon and 140,000 gallons of blood.</p>
