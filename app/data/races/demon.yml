  <p>The Empress has struck a deal with an ancient evil and allied the Empire with Demonic beasts.</p>
  <p>Demonic loyalty is always capricious, but as long as there are souls to collect, the Demons will follow the Empress.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>The soul of every enemy unit killed in battle is collected and can be used to summon stronger demons.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Starts with 666% Morale and 2,000 Souls.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Instead of National Bank, Demons have Sacrificial Altar where peasants can be sacrificed for either 0.5 Soul or 4 bushels of food.</p>
