description: >-
  <p>Distressed by the failed attempt to create an Orcish Navy, the Empress exploited the largest weakness found in Gnomes- their greed.</p>
  <p>By promising them gems and ore, the Empress convinced thousands of Commonwealth Gnomes to join the Empire and build war machines.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>You can have at most two of the elite units per Factory. If you have two Catapults and want to train one Airship, you must have two Factories.</p>
