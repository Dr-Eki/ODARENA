description: >-
  <p>The Dimensionalists are a small cult of worshippers of the starry night sky and cosmic visions.</p>
  <p>They are led by Summoners, who surrender their minds to the stars for the ability to summon powerful beings from distant worlds.</p>
  <p>Dark Elves, Nox, and Nomads have been seen joining the cult. A few other corrupt minds have joined its devotion to the impossible, black expanses.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>In order to attack, a Portal must be opened and used quickly, before it closes. Surviving units return when the portal closes.</p>
