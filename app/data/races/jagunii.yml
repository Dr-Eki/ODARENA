description: >-
  <p>From beyond the Southern Sands come the Jagunii with their enormous War Mammoths, adorned with a nearly impenetrable armour made from an intricate weave of ore and gems.</p>
  <p>The warriors chosen for duty with a War Mammoth commit themselves to a lifelong service &mdash; until glorious death in battle make them part ways. When its warriors die and armour shatters in battle, the Mammoth returns home and can be retrained as a War Mammoth.</p>
  <p>Each War Mammoth fits in its armour four Javalineers and four Lancers.</p>
