name: Beastfolk
alignment: independent
description: >-
  <p>Arcane magic has given life to the beasts of the forest, which have been seen building villages in the forests of the Commonwealth.</p>
  <p>Beastfolk take shelter in the forests and excel at fighting on the open plains.</p>
  <p>Malcontent with their treatment as a part of the Commonwealth, the Beastfolk have broken their treaty and decided to be as they feel best: independent.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Instead of traditional improvements, Beastfolk use natural resources (land types) to strengthen their dominion.</p>

  <li>Offensive Power increased by 0.15 x Plains %.</li>
  <li>Food and Boat production increased by 5 x Water %.</li>
