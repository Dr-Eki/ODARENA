name: Legion II
alignment: evil
description: >-
  <p>The Legion is one of the Empress' finest creation. By taking the most promising younglings from all corners of the Empire away from their families and into lifelong servitude, the Empress is forging an army of total loyalty and devotion to the art of bloodshed.</p>
  <p>Each unit (<em>Legionaire</em>) of the Legion is trained to equal strength. The only thing separating one from another is their ancestral special ability.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>This is the Second Legion, consisting of subjugates of Demon, Lycanthrope, and and Icekin origin. The Reanimated can only be obtained through conversion. Unlike the First Legion, this one can train Spies and Wizards.</p>
