description: >-
  <p>Forever wandering the lands, Nomads are originally humans who rejected settled culture.</p>

  <p>Nomads live in tents which are raised wherever there is barren land, removing the need for tedious construction of homes and barracks.</p>
  <p>The Nomadic army grows stronger the more free land it has to train combat on horseback.</p>
