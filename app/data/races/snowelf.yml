description: >-
  <p>Snow Elves are an isolated elven people living at the highest mountain peaks overlooking the plains of the Commonwealth.</p>
  <p>Hidden by the clouds, they build enormous trebuchets and use powerful magic to throw ice bou lders at great distances.</p>
  <p>They have learned to live with the mighty snowmen, the Yeti, and use their hunger for gryphon eggs to trap and tame them.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>For every ten Gryphon Nests, one wild yeti per tick is trapped. This is doubled if Gryphon's Call is cast.</p>
  <p>Up to 5% of all wild yetis in captivity escape every tick.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Each Trebuchet can throw one Ice Boulder, which is destroyed upon impact. It takes one tick for the Trebuchet to  be able to throw another Ice Boulder.</p>
