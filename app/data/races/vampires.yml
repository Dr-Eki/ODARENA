  <p><strong>Vampiric Conversion</strong></p>
  <p>Vampires have a unique method for converting. Units are converted to different unit types depending on the raw military power of the unit slain.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Weak units (OP/DP < 4) become Servants.</li>
  <li>Average units (OP/DP >= 4 and OP/DP < 7) become Gnarls.</li>
  <li>Strong units (OP/DP >= 7) become Ravagers.</li>
  </ul>
