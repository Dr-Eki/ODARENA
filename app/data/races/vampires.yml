  <p><strong>Vampiric Conversion</strong></p>
  <p>Vampires have a unique method for converting. Units are converted to different unit types depending on the raw military power of the unit slain.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Weak units (up to and including 3 OP/DP) become Servants.</li>
  <li>Average units (4 to 7 OP/DP) become Gnarls.</li>
  <li>Strong units (greater than 7 OP/DP) become Ravagers.</li>
  </ul>
