description: >-
  <p>Cursed with eternal life through a profane malaise, Vampires have roamed as a pack on the fringes of the world seeking shelter in mountainous coasts to the west.</p>
  <p>They live in strict aristocratic societies ruled by a Nobility which claims ancestry to many of the eldest noble families among all elves, orcs, humans, and goblins.</p>
  <p>Instead of slaying their foes, Vampire Nobles drain their enemies of blood and replace it with a goo that transforms them into one three forms.</p>
  <p>Weak foes are turned into Servants, whose only duty is to mindlessly defend the Nobles.</p>
