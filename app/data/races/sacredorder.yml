name: Sacred Order
alignment: good
description: >-
  <p>The Sacred Order is a faction originally formed by Humans who felt that Holy Wars should be lifelong struggles to reach the Divines. Today, people from all over the Commonwealth join the Sacred Order.</p>
  <p>Monks are responsible for providing stable defenses, while Fanatics are seen both defending the holy land and conquering more, strengthened by Temples to the Divines.</p>
  <p>Fanatics can heal fallen enemy soldiers and turn them into Martyrs, arming them to the teeth and preparing them to join the Eternal Lands after sacrificing themselves in battle for the Sacred Order.</p>
  <p>All are lead by Paladins, who are monks trained into warrior elites.</p>
