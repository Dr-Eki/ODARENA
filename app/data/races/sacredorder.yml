description: >-
  <p>The Sacred Order was created by Humans who felt that Crusades should be lifelong struggles to reach the Divines.</p>
  <p>Monks are responsible for providing stable defenses, while Fanatics are seen both defending the holy land and conquering more, strengthened by Temples to the Divines.</p>
  <p>Fanatics can convert some enemy soldiers into Martyrs, which join the infantry alongside the mighty Holy Warriors and Fanatics, which are elite Monks.</p>
