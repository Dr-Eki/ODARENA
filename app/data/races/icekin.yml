description: >-
  <p>Slow, lumbering elementals of frost and stone, Icekin emerged from the snow-capped mountains as a counterweight to unnatural the pyromancy experiments that created the Firewalkers.</p>
  <p>Their creeping cold expands ever outwards, insistent, transforming the lands around them with a white permafrost and hijacking the weather with seemingly never-ending blizzards. Icekin can become an immense military threat once they become well fortified.</p>
