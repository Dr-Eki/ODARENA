name: Dark Elf
alignment: evil
description: >-
  <p>With ashen skin, inky-black eyes and bat-like features, Dark Elves are the cave-dwelling distant cousins of the majestic Wood Elves. Corrupted long ago by the whispered promises of power from fallen demons, the Dark Elves are a cruel species who thrive on torment... be it the torment of their enemies, or even their own kin.</p>
  <p>Dark Elves have black magic coursing through their veins. Capable of calling down a rain of fire and lightning upon their enemies, they are a terrifying force to reckon with - and that's before they even set foot on the battlefield.</p>
