description: >-
  <p>With ashen skin, inky-black eyes and sharp features, Dark Elves are elves who have devoted their lives to dark magic. Corrupted long ago by the whispered promises of power from fallen demons, the Dark Elves are a cruel species who thrive on torment... be it the torment of their enemies, or even their own kin.</p>
  <p>Dark Elves have black magic coursing through their veins. Capable of calling down a rain of fire and lightning upon their enemies, they are a terrifying force to reckon with - and that's before they even set foot on the battlefield.</p>
