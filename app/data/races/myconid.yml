  <p>The Myconids are network of semi-independent sentient Fungus, Psilocybe, and Amanita, which are born from Spores. They also produce Spores and if struck down in combat, return as Spores.</p>
  <p>Whether they cannot or simply do not want to, Mycelia do not invade other dominions. They only gain land by spreading the Mycelia through their units.</p>
