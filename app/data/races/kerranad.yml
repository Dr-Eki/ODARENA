name: Kerranad
alignment: independent
description: >-
  <p>Historically a place of peace and prosperity where arms were deposited with the Immortal Guard before entering the gates, the City-state of Kerranad has been a safe haven for travellers, warriors, wizards, merchants, and artists seeking respite from the ravages of war.</p>
  <p>Kerranad is perched atop a large peninsula surrounded by the cold, deep, dark oceans and a well-defended isthumus bridging it to the mainland. Beneath the great city lie some of the most generous mines of ore and gem.</p>
  <p>War has now reached the gates of the City-state, yet the mayor and his advisers have rejected offers and threats from the Empire and the Commonwealth. Its independence is respected but questioned and tested.</p>
  <p>Assassins are spies trained in the art of hand to hand combat and Battlemages are wizards who pursue the path of war to defend the City-state.</p>
  <p>The Immortals are Guards and elite Knights are the envy of all armies.</p>
